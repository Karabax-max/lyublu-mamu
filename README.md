## **Made a simple app that does image keywording using Everypixel API**

Haven't finished with app design yet, and option page is empty, but the main keywording part is finished.

In options page I planned to add keyword amout setting. By default, after the image is recieved, it's being cut into 16 parts, 
and stored in temporary folder. Afterwards, every slice is keyworded and all the keywords return to the user. So as written before, this
option would let user to choose either they want to get more keywords and scan image in more detail,
or they want overall picture keywording, which will be about 10 keywords.

Design part is a bit complicated to do using tkinter, so probably in future I will change the GUI framework and make the app prettier :)
